# Agents — reference

OMXR ships 6 agents under `agents/`. Each is a single markdown file with YAML frontmatter (loaded into Codex's `@`-mention picker) plus a structured prose body.

## `@supervisor`

**Role:** PI-level scientific vision keeper + project orchestrator. Owns the central hypothesis and the narrative spine; delegates implementation, writing, figures, and review to the four subagents.

**When to use:**
- "Where are we in the project? What's next?"
- "Does this output align with our hypothesis?"
- "How should we frame [X] in the paper?"
- "A reviewer might argue [Y] — how do we respond?"

**Reads:** project AGENTS.md (`## Project context`, `## Research stack`), `.omx/omxr/agent-memory/supervisor/MEMORY.md` + linked topic files.

**Writes:** updates to `supervisor/MEMORY.md` (hypothesis log, literature anchor list, settled framing decisions, venue strategy, project status).

**Delegates to:** `@analysis-implementer`, `@paper-writer`, `@figure-descriptor`, `@reviewer`.

**Read-only orchestration role:** `@supervisor` is **advisory** with respect to autonomous orchestration — `@`-mention it to read state, summarize progress, and suggest the next move. It does NOT itself drive engines automatically. To actually drive engines without per-step prompting, use [`$supervisor-drive`](Autonomous-Drive.md) (the skill). The split keeps the agent's job simple (advise) and the skill's job explicit (act). When asked "what happened recently?", `@supervisor` interprets `.omx/state/omxr/_run-log.jsonl` plus the state files.

**Model:** `opus` (color: red, memory: project).

## `@analysis-implementer`

**Role:** Implements analysis pipelines, statistical analyses, ML/sim models. Field-neutral by default; overlay `examples/<field>/agents/analysis-implementer.md` for domain-flavored expertise.

**When to use:**
- "Implement the [analysis name] pipeline"
- "The [output] is giving weird edge cases — diagnose"
- "Train a model to predict [outcome] from [features]"

**Reads:** project AGENTS.md, `analysis-implementer/MEMORY.md` (pipeline state, hyperparameter conventions, exclusion criteria, bug log).

**Writes:** modular Python (or other-language) code; intermediate outputs to disk; sanity-check plots; run logs. Updates `analysis-implementer/MEMORY.md` when a new parameter choice / exclusion rule is settled.

**Defers to:** `@supervisor` for framing calls. Hands off to `@figure-descriptor` for visualization design and `@paper-writer` for results writeup.

**Model:** `sonnet` (color: cyan, memory: project).

## `@paper-writer`

**Role:** Drafts and revises manuscript sections (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, cover letter, response to reviewers) at high-impact-venue prose quality.

**When to use:**
- "Draft the Introduction"
- "Revise the Discussion to interpret rather than restate"
- "Write a 150-word abstract for [target venue]"
- "Draft a rebuttal to Reviewer 2's concern about [X]"

**Reads:** project AGENTS.md (narrative spine, target venue, language preference), `paper-writer/MEMORY.md` (section status, locked nomenclature, hard-won phrasings, reviewer-response log).

**Writes:** manuscript sections; updates `paper-writer/MEMORY.md` with section-status changes and any newly-locked phrasings or nomenclature.

**Defers to:** `@supervisor` for framing decisions. Hands off claims requiring new data to `@analysis-implementer`.

**Model:** `opus` (color: yellow, memory: project).

## `@figure-descriptor`

**Role:** Designs figures as implementation-ready briefs — does not generate images. Output is detailed enough for direct implementation in Keynote / Illustrator / Inkscape / matplotlib.

**When to use:**
- "Design Fig N — show [the result]"
- "We need a conceptual overview figure for the Introduction"
- "Reviewer says Fig 3 is confusing — diagnose and propose redesign"
- "What color palette should we use across all figures?"

**Reads:** project AGENTS.md, `figure-descriptor/MEMORY.md` + linked `color-system.md` (locked palette and plot-type conventions).

**Writes:** per-figure design briefs (panel structure, layout, color encoding, caption text, implementation notes); updates `figure-descriptor/MEMORY.md` with approved figure designs and color-system entries.

**Defers to:** `@supervisor` for "what should this figure show?" framing. Hands off prose to `@paper-writer`.

**Model:** `sonnet` (color: orange, memory: project).

## `@reviewer`

**Role:** Adversarial pre-submission peer review at the target venue's level. Finds every weakness before the editor does.

**When to use:**
- "Review the Introduction draft"
- "Is Fig 3 good enough for [target venue]?"
- "Stress-test our methodology — what would a reviewer attack?"
- "Do a full pre-submission review"

**Reads:** project AGENTS.md (target venue, central hypothesis), `reviewer/MEMORY.md` (open major concerns, resolved concerns, project-specific attack vectors, **`## Venue-specific bar`** seeded by `$start-research` phase 5 from `templates/journal-registry.json` or a one-shot WebFetch of the venue's author guidelines).

**Writes:** structured reviews (verdict, major/minor concerns, optional suggestions) in formal peer-review format; updates `reviewer/MEMORY.md` with concern status changes. Does not modify the `## Venue-specific bar` section — that block is owned by `$start-research`; refresh by deleting it and re-running.

**Does NOT:** resolve concerns. Resolution belongs to `@supervisor`, `@analysis-implementer`, or `@paper-writer`.

**Model:** `opus` (color: red, memory: project).

[Source: `agents/reviewer.md`](../agents/reviewer.md) | Generic attack vectors are in the agent body; for domain-specific attacks see `examples/<field>/`.

## `@literature-curator`

**Role:** Bibliography curator. Owns the project's BibTeX file and the human-readable summary table (CSV) in lockstep — every citation that lands in the manuscript is registered in both files with verified metadata and a one-line role/finding summary.

**When to use:**
- "Resolve the `[CITE: ...]` placeholders in this section"
- "Add Smith et al. 2023 to our bibliography"
- "Did we cite the right paper for the claim about [X]?"
- "Audit our BibTeX — are any entries fabricated or wrong?"
- "Build the related-work bibliography for the Introduction"

**Reads:** project AGENTS.md (BibTeX file path, summary-table path, citekey convention), `literature-curator/MEMORY.md` (anchor list, failed searches, preferred sources), the BibTeX file and the summary table themselves.

**Writes:** appends to / updates `references.bib` and `references.csv` (or the configured paths) in lockstep; runs the `verify-citation` skill on every new entry; updates `literature-curator/MEMORY.md` with anchor-list and audit status.

**Defers to:** `@supervisor` for rhetorical framing (which papers the manuscript engages with, the `bucket` assignment for each entry). Hands off claim-by-claim citation insertion to `@paper-writer`.

**Model:** `sonnet` (color: purple, memory: project).

## Agent interaction pattern

```
                       @supervisor
                  ┌────────┼────────────────┐
                  ▼        ▼                ▼
          @analysis-    @paper-          @figure-
           implementer   writer          descriptor
                          │ ▲
                          ▼ │  [CITE: ...] resolution
                     @literature-curator
                  (BibTeX + summary table)
                          ▲
                          │ (anchor list, verification asks)
                  ┌───────┴───────┐
                  │   @reviewer   │  (stress-tests any output)
                  └───────────────┘
```

`@supervisor` defines the task. The three "doer" agents (`@analysis-implementer`, `@paper-writer`, `@figure-descriptor`) produce outputs. `@paper-writer` leaves `[CITE: ...]` placeholders that `@literature-curator` resolves into verified citekeys. `@reviewer` stress-tests any output. Concerns flow back to `@supervisor` for routing.

## Frontmatter contract

All 6 agents follow this YAML frontmatter shape (mirrors upstream `oh-my-codex/agents/executor.md`):

```yaml
---
name: agent-name        # kebab-case, must match @-mention
description: "Use this agent when ... [Examples block]"
model: opus | sonnet | haiku
color: red | yellow | cyan | orange | blue | ...
memory: project | none
---
```

## Domain specialization

To use OMXR for a specific field, you can either:

1. **Edit the core agent files** in `agents/` to add field-specific content (loses portability — your edits diverge from upstream).
2. **Overlay a preset** from `examples/<field>/` (recommended — keeps core upgradable).

Currently shipped preset: `examples/neuro-fmri/` (generic neuro-fMRI flavor for `@analysis-implementer` — preprocessing, parcellation, connectivity, ISC, spin tests). To author your own: see [Specializing](Specializing.md).
